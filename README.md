  # Reconstructed v0 Project

    This project was reconstructed from files saved from a live deployment generated by v0.dev. The original source code was lost.

    ## Important Notes

    *   **Source Code Origin:** The React component code (`.tsx` files) was extracted from data embedded within the saved HTML file. This provides a much more accurate representation of the component logic than reverse-engineering compiled JS.
    *   **Configuration:** Files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js` were inferred or generated using standard defaults. Dependency versions might need adjustment. Some Shadcn UI components might need to be re-added via the CLI.
    *   **Potential Issues:** While this reconstruction aims to be functional, subtle differences from the original v0 environment or missing configurations might cause issues.
    *   **Best Recovery:** Checking your v0.dev account history remains the best way to potentially recover the *exact* original source code.

    ## Getting Started

    1.  **Install Dependencies:**
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        yarn install
        # or
        pnpm install
        ```
        (If you encounter peer dependency issues, try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`)

    2.  **Initialize Shadcn UI (if needed):**
        ```bash
        npx shadcn-ui@latest init
        ```
        (Follow prompts, try to match original settings if possible)

    3.  **Add Missing Shadcn UI Components:**
        Check `src/components/ui` and add any missing standard components:
        ```bash
        npx shadcn-ui@latest add avatar badge button card dialog input label calendar select separator tabs # Add others as needed
        ```

    4.  **Run Development Server:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # or
        yarn dev
        # or
        pnpm dev
        ```
